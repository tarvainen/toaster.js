# toaster.js
The javascript client library for showing simple messages (toasts) to user

## Installation
Just run `npm install toaster.js` in your project root to install toaster.js via npm.

## Usage
Include the both javascript and the css file in to your web page.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    
    <html>
    
    <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="toaster_folder/toaster.css"/>
    </head>
    
    <body>
    <button onclick="makeMyToast()">Click me!</button>
    </body>
    
    <script src="toaster_folder/toaster.js"></script> <!-- toaster script -->
    <script src="index.js"></script> <!-- your own scripts -->
    </html>

In your `index.js` define the `makeMyToast()` function to do something wild.

    function makeMyToast () {
        var text = 'This will be your wild toast!';
        toaster.makeText(text, toaster.error, toaster.short);
    }

You can also define callbacks for `onShow` and `onHide` events.

    toaster.on('show', function () {
        console.log('Toast is now visible.');
    });
    
    toaster.on('hide', function () {
        console.log('Toast is now hidden.');
    });
    
Of course you can also show and hide the toast manually using `toaster.show()` and `toaster.hide()` functions.

    window.addEventListener('keydown', function () {
        toaster.hide();
    });
    
### Customizing the toast
By default the toast contains two HTML elements: the wrapper and the toast itself. The wrapper is covering the whole view and it is useful for making some kind of transparent cover for the whole page. The wrapper div has an id `#toaster-wrapper` so by using the id you are able to change the appearance of the wrapper.

The toast itself is just an `<p></p>` element and it has an id `#toaster-textnode`. By using that id you are able to change the appearance of the textnode of toaster.js.

For example, in your own `css` define next rules.

    #toaster-wrapper {
        background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    }
    
    #toaster-textnode {
        padding: 5px;
        border-radius: 5px;
        background: rgba(80, 80, 80, 0.9);
    }
    
The toast is made visible by adding the `.toaster-visible` class name to the both `wrapper` and the `textnode`. On the other hand the toast is hidden by replacing the `.toaster-visible` with `.toaster-hidden`. Knowing that you are able to for example animate your toast.

### All methods

#### toaster.setup (opts)
Sets all the parameters given in the `opts` object to toasterÂ´s parameters.

#### toaster.makeText (text, type, duration, callback)
Creates the toast where the text is the `text`. Type variable is actually a function which will be ran after the `toaster-visible` class is 
added to the element. There you can define what will be done to the elements (for maybe styling them by adding classes). 
`Duration` is just a plain number which represents the toast length in milliseconds. `Callback` will be called after the toast is gone.

You can define `type` variables to the toaster.js for easier use by using the `toaster.defineMessageType (type, term)` function.

#### toaster.show ()
Sets the toaster visible.

#### toaster.hide ()
Sets the toaster invisible.

#### toaster.error ()
Predefined message type representing the message type error. Is used in the `toaster.makeText (text, type, duration, callback)` as the `type` parameter.

#### toaster.short
It's just an ugly plain property `2000` and is used as a `duration` parameter in the `toaster.makeText (text, type, duration, callback)` function.

#### toaster.long
Another toaster's predefined property representing the value `5000`. Is used just to make 5 seconds long toasts.

#### toaster.defineMessageType (type, term)
Is used to define message type for the toaster for later simpler usage. See the example below.

Define in your `index.js` ...

    toaster.defineMessageType('myOwnMessageType', function () {
      this.textnode.class += ' myCssClass';
    });
    
    toaster.makeText('This is my toast!', toaster.myOwnMessageType, toaster.short);
    
... and in your own css file add the following rule.

    .myCssClass {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      padding: 100000px;
      color: rgba(14, 67, 45, 0.25);
    }
    
#### toaster.defineMessageLength (name, length)
Is used to define message length for the toaster for later simpler usage. See the example below.

Define in your `index.js` following lines

    toaster.defineMessageLength('mySuperLongMessage', 1000000);
    
    toaster.makeText('This is my toast!', toaster.success, toaster.mySuperLongMessage);
